# Compare the Performance of Uninformed and Informed Searches

I compared the performance of these two algorithms by the number of iterations in the main while that it took to find the shortest path. On the path 0-99(whose shortest path is [0,99]), the performance was the same. Which makes sense, considering that the path is so trivial, and all other paths to 99 are longer so only the same nodes have to be explored. For longer paths, I saw a relatively, as no number of iterations was very large,  significant decrease in the number of iterations used by the A* algorithm. This can be explained by the nature of informed searches. Not only is the 'backward' distance to the start considered, as in Dijkstra's algorithm, but the forward distances as well. This leads to a faster convergence on a shortest path, and therefore fewer iterations and increased performance as future distances or roadblocks can be anticipated and avoided. While the differences were not large on this relatively small problem, this benefits would compound on graphs in the thousands of nodes and ends and the increase in performance would be very noticeable.
